### A simple service for converting animated gifs to animated ascii SVGs!

Animated ASCII Art is best stored as an SVG file because of the lossless font rendering and minimal filesize.  So this tool uses OpenCV on a server to "fit" the optimal ASCII Characters to the laplacian of any (small) `.gif` that you feed it to make it an animated ascii `.svg`!
